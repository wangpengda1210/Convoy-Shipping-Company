<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Your database is ready. As you may have expected, you still don't have the final Excel version. Your boss told you that you will have to export part of the database to two different systems. You don't know which data goes where, but rumor has it you will need a scoring automat for this. For now, your algorithm should export all the database entries. The first system needs the data in the JSON format.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Print the <code class="language-json">Input file name</code> text.</li>
	<li>Ask the user to give a name to the input file. Acceptable extensions are <em>.xlsx, .csv, %...[CHECKED]%.csv.</em>, and <em>.s3db.</em></li>
	<li>If your file is <em>.xlsx </em>or <em>.csv</em>,<em> </em>or it ends with the %...<em>[CHECKED]%.csv</em>, perform all previous transformations in the correct order until you get an SQLite3 file.</li>
	<li>Once you got an SQLite3 file, generate a JSON file with the same name; use the <em>.json </em>extension.</li>
	<li>The JSON object should have the following structure:
	<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "convoy": [
        {
            "vehicle_id": 2,
            "engine_capacity": 200,
            "fuel_consumption": 25,
            "maximum_load": 70
        },
        {
            "vehicle_id": 1024,
            "engine_capacity": 500,
            "fuel_consumption": 80,
            "maximum_load": 150
        }
    ]
}</code></pre>
	</li>
	<li>Save the data to a file as a single string.</li>
	<li>Count the number of entries exported to the JSON file.</li>
	<li>Your program should output the following message: <code class="language-json">X vehicles were saved</code> or <code class="language-json">1 vehicle was saved</code>, where <code class="language-json">X</code> is a number of inserted entries. It should also include the output file name.<br>
	For example: <code class="language-json">10 vehicles were saved into %file_name%.json</code>.</li>
	<li>Display all the previous outputs for the conversions you have made.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>You can use the <em>.s3db </em>test file from the previous stage as a sample.</p>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="language-json">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Input file name
&gt; data_one_xlsx.xlsx
1 line was added to data_one_xlsx.csv
4 cells were corrected in data_one_xlsx[CHECKED].csv
1 record was inserted into data_one_xlsx.s3db
1 vehicle was saved into data_one_xlsx.json</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Input file name
&gt; data_big_csv.csv
12 cells were corrected in data_big_csv[CHECKED].csv
10 records were inserted into data_big_csv.s3db
10 vehicles were saved into data_big_csv.json</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Input file name
&gt; data_big_chk[CHECKED].csv
10 records were inserted into data_big_chk.s3db
10 vehicles were saved into data_big_chk.json</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Input file name
&gt; data_one_sql.s3db
1 vehicle was saved into data_one_sql.json
</code></pre>
